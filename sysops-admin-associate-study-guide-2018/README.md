[AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Official Study Guide: Associate Exam](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-SysOps-Administrator-Official-Study/dp/1119377420) was purchased in Feburary 2018 in hopes of better understanding AWS as a infrastructure platform. As a developer with aspirations of future complex projects, I figure the knowledge of AWS will help drastically. I think learning this skillset will help me if I want to explore other cloud service providers like Google Cloud,
Microsoft Azure, or any others that may crop up in the near future.
