## AWS SysOps Practice
The goal of this repo is to contain exercise code generated while training for AWS SysOps certification. Exercises will be mined from various sources.

There will most likely be overlap in exercises.

## Quizlet
I created a quizlet AWS folder to store flashcards for AWS related vocabulary and to ask/answer review questions.

If you are interested in using these, navigate to [My AWS Quizlet Folder](https://quizlet.com/borallis/folders/aws) and study!

## Gitbook
Building this documentation was done using gitbook, build on Node. If you would like to contribute (or you are the original author and have forgotten how to run/build this), install node (via NVM, perhaps?) and run `npm install` to install project dependencies. To serve files locally, run `npm start`. Once satisfied, build files to GitPages friendly `/docs` folder by running `npm run build` to generate relevant files.
